	Abstract = {Scientific learning is an iterative process employing Criticism and Estimation. Correspondingly the formulated model factors into two complementary parts--a predictive part allowing model criticism, and a {B}ayes posterior part allowing estimation. Implications for significance tests, the theory of precise measurement and for ridge estimates are considered. Predictive checking functions for transformation, serial correlation, bad values, and their relation with {B}ayesian options are considered. Robustness is seen from a {B}ayesian viewpoint and examples are given. For the bad value problem a comparison with M estimators is made.},
