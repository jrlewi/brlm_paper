# brlmPaperCode
Code used for our Bayesian Restricted Likelihood Paper. A version of this paper is available on Yoon Lee's website (http://www.stat.osu.edu/~yklee/mss/tr878.pdf). Much of this work is also part of my dissertation (https://etd.ohiolink.edu/!etd.send_file?accession=osu1407505392&amp;disposition=inline).

The goal is to consolidate this code into an R package 'brlm' which is currently in development on my github site at jrlewi/brlm
